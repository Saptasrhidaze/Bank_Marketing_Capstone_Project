    "# Bank Marketing Dataset\n",
    "- The [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) contains a reasonable large number of data related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.\n",
    "- It is a fairly large dataset with 41K+ rows, a mixture of categorical and continuous columns as well as data imperfections to identify and manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "The data has the following columns\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bank client data:\n",

    "## Goal\n",
    "The goal of this project is \n",
    "1. Build and Tune the hyperparameters of a Sklearn model to predict the target column `y` using AWS Sagemaker \n",
    "1. Deploy the model as a `Serverless Inference Endpoint` and test it\n",
    "1. Run `Batch Transform` on the entire input dataset\n",
    "1. Calculate the performance of the model predictions on the entire input dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended Steps\n",
    "1. **Data Exploration:** Understand the data by looking at distributions and unique values in the columns. Are there any issues with the data?\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning:** Handle any issues you found with the data.\n",
    "1. **Feature Engineering:** Handle the various datatypes by applying the appropriate feature engineering techniques\n",
    "1. **Model Selection:** Choose an appropriate sklearn model for this problem and implement the sagemaker model training code\n",
    "1. **Hyperparameter tuning:** Choose appropriate hyperparameter ranges and objective metric for the chosen model and implement the sagemaker hyperparameter tuning code\n",
    "1. **Model training:** Submit the hyperparameter tuning job to sagemaker and monitor the execution progress\n",
    "1. **Model deployment as severless inference:** Pick the best model from hyperparameter tuning, deploy it as a sagemaker serverless inference endpoint and test if it works by posting some sample data to it\n",
    "1. **Batch transform:** Store the input dataset to a json lines file, deploy the model as a batch transform and run the batch transform job on the input json lines file.\n",
    "1. **Performance calculation:** Calculate model performance on the entire input dataset using output of the batch transform job.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "- You can use the below code to get the S3 bucket to write any artifacts to\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    import sagemaker\n",
    "    session = sagemaker.Session()\n",
    "    bucket = session.default_bucket()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- Are all the columns necessary or can we drop any?\n",
    "- Does the data contain any issues?\n",
    "- What ML task is this? Classification? Regression? Clustering?\n",
    "- What are the data types of the columns? What pre-processing should you apply?\n",
    "- What is the most appropriate metric for this model?"
